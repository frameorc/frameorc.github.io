frameorc is not a framework. It is a collection of libraries that help building
web applications.

[dom](doc/dom.md): JavaScript library that helps building user interfaces
in browsers by manipulating DOM trees. Brutally simple and efficient,
it was created with the goal of endowing a single programmer and small teams
with formidable power.

[router](doc/router.md): flexible function that dynamically loads
modules and updates the page or a component based on the current route.

[flex.css](doc/flex.html): a stylesheet for nested flexible blocks. Great for
building forms and programmatic UIs.

[state](doc/state.md): building block for persistent state services. Fast
solution for durability of complex data structures.
