frameorc is not a framework. It is a collection of libraries that help building
web applications.

[dom](doc/dom.md): JavaScript library that helps building user interfaces
in browsers by manipulating DOM trees. Brutally simple and efficient,
it was created with the goal of endowing a single programmer and small teams
with formidable power.

[router](doc/router.md): flexible function that dynamically loads
modules and updates the page or a component based on the current route.
